This solution is based on the JHipster Yeoman generator which generates a skeleton for the AngularJS front-end and Spring Boot back-end type of applications.
I used it since I started using it for my own projects recently.

For development purposes local H2 on disk DB is used which is generated automatically after starting application in the development mode:
1. unzip project zip file
2. cd <unzipped_project_folder>
3. run `npm install`
4. run `./mvnw`

After successful bootstrap procedure a local instance of embedded Tomcat and H2 DB should be running and the application should be accesible at http://localhost:8080

There are 2 preconfigured users:
1. user:user
2. admin:admin

User has only view/read-only permissions for Pet resource and admin user has all permitions.
